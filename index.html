      <h2>Professional Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Passionate about economics and market research, I believe that international trading is an opportunity for me to combine my interests in finance and investment strategies.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I have two great passions: music and handball. Handball is a sport that teaches me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance—values I consider essential in both my personal and professional life. I am also an active member of the IÉSEG handball association. Music, for me, is a source of inspiration and escape, allowing me to connect with different cultures and emotions.
